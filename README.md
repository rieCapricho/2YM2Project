**Troubleshooting Tips**
If you encounter any issues during installation or execution, here are some common solutions:

**1. Apache or MySQL Not Starting in XAMPP:**
- Check if another application (like Skype) is using the same port (80 for Apache or 3306 for MySQL).
- You can change the port settings in XAMPP if needed.
**2. node server.js Command Not Working:**
- Ensure you have installed Node.js correctly.
- Make sure youâ€™re in the correct folder (C:\M2Project) in your command prompt.
- Run npm install in the folder to install all necessary dependencies before running node server.js.
**3. Browser Not Showing Project:**
- Ensure Apache and MySQL are both running in XAMPP.
- Double-check the server URL (localhost:3000).
**4. Database Issues:**
- If you have trouble with the database import, verify that the database cirva_database is created in phpMyAdmin and try importing the SQL file again.
- Check for any errors in the import log in phpMyAdmin.
